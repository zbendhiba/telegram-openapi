About
Hello there 👋Permalink
I’m Zineb Bendhiba, an Open Source Java developer with over 15 years of experience, deeply passionate about addressing complex challenges within Cloud Native environments. I am dedicated to using and contributing to Open Source projects to tackle these challenges.

I believe in the strength and adaptability of Apache Camel as an integration framework. Within the Apache Camel project, I actively contribute to addressing diverse integration challenges, which underscores my enduring dedication to solving complex problems over the course of my career.

Through my active involvement in the Apache Camel community, I’ve gained extensive experience in modern Cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes, Quarkus, and Knative. I continually seek innovative ways to apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios.

Engaged in various open source and women in tech communities, I actively participate as a tech speaker, sharing insights and experiences with fellow enthusiasts.
